Too many choices create friction. The fix isn’t fewer options — it’s better filters.

## The Four Constraints That Work

- Mood first: comfort, laughs, thrills, thoughtful
- Runtime cap: 90 or 120 minutes
- Platform focus: one service per session
- Rule of Three: pick from three options when the timer ends

## Curated Inputs Beat Raw Feeds

Follow critics, festivals, and trusted friends. Seed your list with their picks. Algorithms amplify; you choose the seeds.
